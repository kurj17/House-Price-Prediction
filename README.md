## House-Price-Prediction
Python Jackfruit Problem using basics of data analysis and machine learning

# Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices using key 
such as living area, overall quality, basement size, garage capacity, year built, neighbourhood, 
and house style. The dataset is cleaned by filling missing numerical values with means and 
categorical values with "None", followed by preprocessing through one-hot encoding and 
training a Linear Regression model for price estimation. The trained model is then deployed 
through a simple wxPython GUI that allows users to input house details and receive accurate, 
real-time price predictions.
